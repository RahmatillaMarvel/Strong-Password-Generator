# Strong Password Generator

A simple Python script that generates strong and memorable passwords. 

## Introduction

In the modern digital age, online security is crucial, and one of the first lines of defense is a strong and secure password. Weak passwords can make your accounts vulnerable to unauthorized access and security breaches. The Strong Password Generator project aims to provide a user-friendly solution for creating robust passwords that are also easy to remember.

## Features

- **Strong Passwords**: The generator creates highly secure passwords by combining a mix of words, numbers, and special characters.

- **Memorability**: We understand the importance of creating passwords that you can remember. Our algorithm strikes a balance between security and ease of recall, resulting in passwords that are both robust and user-friendly.

- **Customization**: Tailor your password to meet specific requirements, such as length and complexity, by adjusting the generator's parameters.

- **Randomness**: The passwords generated are truly random, making them extremely difficult for attackers to predict or crack.
